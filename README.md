# Project2Repo

Our project is a cardboard enclosure based on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. It’s shaped to feel like a journey downward, just like Orpheus going into the underworld to save her. The layers and lighting create a dark-to-light effect that shows hope and danger at the same time. The whole piece is meant to let people step into the moment where he’s trying to lead her back—and the risk of turning around changes everything.
